This challenge was to demonstrate the use of matplotlib.pyplot, pandas, and statistics to manipulate the data from a study of different drug treatment regimens conducted on mice to test their success in potential treatment of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer tumors.

Analysis

- This study shows that mice on the Capomulin drug regimen yielded the best results in shrinking the Tumor Volume (mm3) against all other drug regimens, except for the Ramicane drug which yielded comparible and slightly better results. (It should also be noted that Capomulin and Ramicane also had more timepoints of data included in the study)

- There is a positive correlation between the weight of the mouse and the the size of the tumor; meaning the more the mouse weighs the greater the avgerage tumor volume was.

- Mouse gender was close to equally represented thoughout the study as a whole. More analysis would need to be conducted to determine whether gender was a factor in the drug success amongst the Campomulin and Ramicane regimens.
- More analysis would also need to be conducted to determine if mouse age was a factor in the drug regimen results.
